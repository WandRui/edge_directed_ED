## Description
In this project, we apply posterization with error diffusing dithering. We implement 3 dithering method: classic Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, and edge-directed. We add a choice bar under the "Posterization" processor in basic operation. The additional threshold slide is only for controlling the stength threshold of edge detection for edge-directed dithering method. We also add some more images beside the original course lab.
## Functionalities and Features
- A choice bar under "Basic processing -- Posterization" to choose error diffusing method
- A threshold slide for controlling sobel edge detection strength (only work for edge-directed method)
- Three more images to choose beside original course lab
